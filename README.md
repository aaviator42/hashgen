# hashgen
PHP script to generate password hashes

Use this to generate PHP `password_hash() BCRYPT` hashes that can be hardcoded into tiny scripts. [This](https://github.com/aaviator42/simple-login) is a simple login script that uses hardcoded hashes generated by this script, for example.

*Try it out:* an instance of this script is hosted [here](https://aavi.xyz/proj/hashgen/). Passwords and hashes are not stored, but you as a rule you shouldn't trust strangers on the internet and should probably run stuff that deals with passwords and secrets on machines controlled by you.
